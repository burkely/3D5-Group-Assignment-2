# 3D5-Group-Assignment-2

Final assignmet, Semester 1, for 3D5 - Software Dev and Implementation. ~3/4 weeks

The app we decided to build, "Convene", is a platform that allows users to send meeting requests to friends/contacts with the app.
If a meeting is agreed upon, their locations will be sent to a server that will send back suggestions for pubs and cafes around 
a midpoint location in a google map fragment. Either friend can choose a place to meet (and soon a time) and both users will then be routed via google maps
to the chosen meeting location. 

We choose this app idea as it allowed us to integrate a lot of useful APIs such as the facebook API for logins and getting freinds, 
google play services APIs that allow use to use google maps, getting locations, google cloud messaging to send notifications.
We also have to implement a server side application for users to communicate with and to implement GCM, and a SQL database that stores
information about our users such as facebook ID, phone number and GCM Registration token to allow us to push notifications.
